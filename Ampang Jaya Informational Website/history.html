                    <h2>19th Century: Tin Mining Era</h2>
                    <p>Ampang Jaya dates back to the 19th century when tin mining was a major industry in the area. The town was originally named after the Ampang River, which runs through the area. The name "Ampang" is believed to have been derived from the Malay word "ampangan", which means "the place where the river widens".</p>
                    <p>The area was originally inhabited by the indigenous Orang Asli people, who were hunter-gatherers. In the mid-19th century, Chinese immigrants began to arrive, attracted by the opportunities offered by the tin mining industry. These early immigrants established a community which still exists today.</p>
